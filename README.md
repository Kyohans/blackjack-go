# Blackjack

This repo holds a simple blackjack game that can be played through your console provided you have Go installed. The purpose of this project is to practice Test Drive Development principles and learn Go.

To play it, enter the following into your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kyohans/blackjack-go.git
cd blackjack-go
go run blackjack_console.go
```
Unlike the real blackjack game, this game keeps tracks of the score between the player and the dealer instead of keeping track of money.

There are still a lot of room for improvement though so I'd like to:
- Clean up as much code as I can
- Abide by Software Design principles
- Potentially work on a GUI
- Add splitting and doubling down (2x score)
