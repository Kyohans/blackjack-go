# Blackjack

This repo holds a simple blackjack game that can be played through your console provided you have Go installed. The purpose of this project is to practice Test Drive Development principles and learn Go.

To play it, enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kyohans/blackjack-go.git
cd blackjack-go
go run blackjack_console.go
```

There are still a lot of room for improvement though so I'd like to:
- Clean up as much code as I can
- Abide by Software Design Principles such as DRY
- Potentially work on a GUI
